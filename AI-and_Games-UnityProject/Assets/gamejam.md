perquisition happens every x time. 

When this happens, cops start looking for you and you have to free yourself of every object you have. 
	you can do it hiding them in secret spots or giving them to other prisoners.
	Once you put away your item there is a rounded baloon(on the top of the secret place or the prisoner) that indicate what object is "stored". You can come back to take it after perquisitions. But for example if you gave it to a prisoner there will be a triangle baloon with the image of what the prisoner wnat to give you back the item. Maybe you need to go to the kitchen room and take some food, or it wants some soap.. something like this

I was thinking at the core of the game at something like you have to conplete a series of interaction to escape and you have multiple solution.
The player can interact with objects and if it's "collectable" there will be the pop up to take it, if there are other actions there will pop up explaining other actions.
For example: you want to escape with the classic tunnel behind the toilet inside your cell. You interact with the toilet and a pop up says you. That you need a screwdriver to unscrew the screws, xand you start searching around the prison for a screwdriver. You interact with objects or priaoner to see if anyone can have it. And when you find it a pop up sayis you whats needed to take the scredriver. And so on
Its like a graphic adventure puzzle solving but with the cops around that make it harder


i was also thinking about some safespace, i mean somethin where you can put inside the item without negative effects but there are very few of them and are very spaced apart, so the player have more risk using only those, because cops could find something on the player while he's going to those objects

Object for escape:
- A toilet with some kind of secret tunnel behind
- Ventilation duct
Object to collect (in the environment)
- Soap
- Toothpaste
- Book
- Toilet Paper
- Apple
- Chewingum
- Paper and Pencil

Object for escape:
- A toilet with some kind of secret tunnel behind
- Ventilation duct
Object to collect (in the environment)
- Soap
- Toothpaste
- Book
- Toilet Paper
- Apple
soap and toothpaste are found in the bath's cabinets
toilet paper in the cells' WC
books in the libraries
apple in food containers (the ugly ones)
screwdriver are from prisoners
spoon on some tables of kitchens
do we have some outline for interactable objects when you put the mouse on them?

screwdrivers are only given from prisoners

unlock toilet
	the one in the kitchen  requires screwdriver and books
	the one in the cells requires screwdriver and spoon

Escape from prison without getting caught.
- Search for the right objects to escape 
- Trade with prisoners for goodies
- Avoid cops perquisition, or you will lose everything

Click for movement.
Click on objects to interact with them and take objects.
Click on prisoners with requested items to trade.
Click on escapes with request object to evade from prison.

That's what i was thinking about for the tutorial, feel free to change it
for the vents can we have a permanent overlay so the player always knows where to escape?
